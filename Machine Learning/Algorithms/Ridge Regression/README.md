## **RIDGE REGRESSION**

**INTRODUCTION**

Ridge regression is a method of estimating the coefficients of multiple-regression models in scenarios where independent variables are highly correlated. It has uses in fields including econometrics, chemistry, and engineering.

**PURPOSE**

The main prupose is to give a clear understanding on what basically Ridge Regression algorithm is all about, its working, usage, libaries used, advantages, disadvantages etc.

**DATASET**

**BRIEF EXPLANATION**
- Let's understand Ridge Regression algorithm with help of the poject 'Air Quality Prediction' 
- Steps been followed are as:

    Step 1:Data Exploration

    Step 2: Data Cleaning

    Step 3: Data Visualization

    Step 4:Data training

    Step 5: Model Creation

    Step 6: Performance Evaluation


**WORKING CONDITIONS**
1.  Data preprocessing and exploration to understand what kind of data will we working on.

- Here we work on preprocessing and exploring the data to understand what kind of data we are working on, it's shape, memory usage, columns, data types etc.



2. Also, we need to check for any null or missing values, if found then replace or remove them accordingly.


3.  Data visualization to draw insights and get better underdstanding on different columns present in the dataset.








4. Data training using train-test-split method from sklearn to split the data into training and testing data and then  Model creation using ridge regression algorithm, where we import the model, then initialize it and fit training data into it and lastly perform predictions on the test data.






5.  Checking performance by error and accuracy check to find how efficient algorithm performed for this project.






**USAGE**
- It is basically used for REGRESSION TASKS.
- Various sectors as engineering, healthcare, education etc.

**USE CASES**
- Regression tasks.
- Mainly used for complex projects.


**LIBRARIES USED**
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn
- numpy

**ADVANTAGES**

- Easy understand & interpret
- Good for Regression tasks


**DISADVANTAGES**

- Relationship between features should be well understood or else it might give low performance efficiency.
- Can give low accuracy if features are not identified properly.
- Cannot be used for classification projects.

**APPLICATIONS**

- Used in different various regression tasks.
- Used in real life in many areas such as engineering, healthcare, civil planning, law, and business.
- Can help in improving business plan by providing fruitful insights and prediction analysis.

**CONCLUSION**

*  For this project i.e. 'Air Quality Prediction', accuracy  is 79.35%

*  It Can help in improving business plan by providing fruitful insights and prediction analysis.
