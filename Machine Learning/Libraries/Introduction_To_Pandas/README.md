**PROJECT TITLE**

The project title should be "Introduction To Pandas" i.e, Pan (Panel) + Das (Data)


**GOAL**

This helps readers in giving all the guidance that one needs to learn about pandas. Tutorial to pandas and how it's applied using sample code.


**PURPOSE**

The main objective of pandas is the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real-world data analysis in Python.Ability to load information into dataframes which allows 
code to reason about columns of data at a time.


**DESCRIPTION**
Pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. 
In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.

**WHAT I HAD DONE**

The main intention of this repo is to educate beginners with all the concepts related to datascience so that they could feel confident to apply these things learnt in practical exposure.


**WORKFLOW OF YOUR PROJECT FILES**

Firstly,
-> Series(Create,Append,Slicing etc)
-> Dataframe (create with random indices , column wise, row wise deletion etc)
-> Data Selection in DataFrame
-> Set value
-> Dealing with NULL value
-> Descriptive Statistics
-> Apply Function on DataFrame
-> Importing multiple CSV files in DataFrame
-> Merging DataFrame using Inner join,left outer join,right outer join
-> Crosstab in Pandas
-> Row & Column Bind
and Many more operations


**USAGE**
The main intention of this repo is to educate beginners with all the concepts related to datascience so that they could feel confident to apply these things learnt in practical exposure.

**LIBRARIES USED**

Pandas (Pip install pandas)

**ADVANTAGES**
1-Makes data flexible and customizable
2-Efficiently handles large data
3-Pandas to perform various tasks like filtering your data according to certain conditions, or segmenting and segregating the data according to preference, etc
4-Less writing and more work done
5- Data Indexing and subsetting higher volume dataset.

**DISADVANTAGES**
1-Poor compatibility for 3D matrices
2- A complex syntax which is not always in line with Python
3-The functionality becomes extremely confusing and can cause beginners some problems.(Steep learning curve)

**APPLICATIONS**
Stock Prediction,Recommendation Systems(netflix),Neuroscience,Advertising,Statistics,Analytics,Natural Language Processing,Big Data etc.

**CONCLUSION**
Python is one of the most versatile and stable languages in over a decade. In this extremely stable programmatic setup, panda library programs hold a great role in boosting the data-related aspects of this widely spread language. 
All the major data handling-related needs of this flexible language is nicely addressed in pandas setup.
