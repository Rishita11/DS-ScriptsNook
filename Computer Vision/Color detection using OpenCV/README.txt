PROJECT TITLE - Color Detection using OpenCV

INTRODUCTION - It uses OpenCV libarary which detects colors in an image and their proportions using a pie chart

PURPOSE - To detect colours in images and bring out images that has required colors

BRIEF EXPLANATION - It uses OpenCV library to proportionate colors in images provided

WORKING CONDITIONS:
- The user must provide the images that he wants to detect colours of.
- It will take the colours into bluish mode as CV library foloows BGR hierarchy.
- It must be converted to RGB mode for correct colours, the image can be converted to gray scale also.
- Further, now that we have found colours, there can be images found with the required colours that we want

USE CASES - It can be used to detect colors of light, as well as food, beverage, automotive industries,etc.

LIBRARIES USED - CV2 library, matplotlib library,sklearn, numpy,collections, skimage, os 

ADVANTAGES - Color detection in images, convert it to different scales

APPLICATIONS - Same as use cases

CONCLUSION - Detection of colors in images using libraries in python
